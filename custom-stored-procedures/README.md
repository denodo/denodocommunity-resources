# Denodo Community Custom Stored Procedures

[Denodo](https://www.denodo.com/) is the leading logical data management platform. It establishes a unified data accessibility framework that provides data consumers with real-time insights from diverse data sources.

This project mantains some sample **custom stored procedures** that any user can use in his/her own Denodo installation.

## Custom Stored Procedures

This is the list of available Custom Stored Procedures created in Java code:

* **[DenodoCdcDebeziumStruct](./com/denodo/vdp/demo/storedprocedure/DenodoCdcDebeziumStruct.java)**: this is a sample stored procedure created for the [Real-Time Change Data Capture with Debezium and Denodo](https://community.denodo.com/kb/en/view/document/Real-Time%20Change%20Data%20Capture%20with%20Debezium%20and%20Denodo) Knowledge Base article at the Denodo Community Site.
* **[GetClients](./com/denodo/vdp/custom/sp/GetClients.java)**: this is a sample stored procedure created in the [Denodo Custom Components Tutorial](https://community.denodo.com/tutorials/browse/customcomponents/index) at the Denodo Community Site.
