# Denodo Community Custom Functions

[Denodo](https://www.denodo.com/) is the leading logical data management platform. It establishes a unified data accessibility framework that provides data consumers with real-time insights from diverse data sources.

This project mantains some sample **custom functions** that any user can use in his/her own Denodo installation.

### Custom Functions

This is the list of available Custom Functions:

* [StringConcatenate](./com/denodo/vdp/custom/functions/StringConcatenate.java): this is a sample custom function used in the [Denodo Custom Components Tutorial](https://community.denodo.com/tutorials/browse/customcomponents/index) at the Denodo Community Site.
